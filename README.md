I'm Rifat Masud. A fullstack web developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I love all things related to web develpment, artificial intelligence and programming. I'm specifically skilled in Javascript, ReactJS, NextJS, Firebase, GraphQL, MongoDB, Python, Django, FastAI, Pytorch.   

As a student in North South University, I was a part of a Mars Rover team [**NSU Mars Ex**](www.mars-ex.com) and led the software team to automate the rover using Python and its variety of libraries (OpenCV, Pytorch, FastAI etc) in a Raspberry PI environment. I helped create the official website for the team using modern fullstack solutions. 

Currently looking for a job, with a view to learn, grow and help building in world class web applications with probably a sprinkle of AI on top it ðŸ˜‰.
